# ( Equation ) First Specify if the input is an equation ( 1 ) or only a single application of the rule ( 0 )
# ( Xi ) is the initial point
# If The Equation was set to "0" you need to provide The Values First
# Derivative ( dr ) And Second Derivative ( Ddr ). if not selected keep 0
# If The Equation was set to "1" you need to provide The Equation in the function ( F ) if not selected keep 0
# ( n ) is the number of Iterations needed
